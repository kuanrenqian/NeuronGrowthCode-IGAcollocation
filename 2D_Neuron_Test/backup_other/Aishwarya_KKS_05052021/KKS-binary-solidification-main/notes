This directory contains code for binary solidification using the
Kim-Kim-Suzuki model [1] for interfacial energy. This allows easy specification
of gamma, but requires constant chemical potential through the interface.
The implementation involves iteratively solving for chemical composition in
pure phases such that the chemical potential constraint is satisfied [2].
